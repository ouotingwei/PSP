# PSP (Plasma Shoes Projecct)
This project involves the design of a plasma spraying process machine system for automated shoe manufacturing. It includes features such as path planning algorithms, real-time imaging, visual recognition, integration with PLC, and the ability to perform real-time parameter adjustment and emergency stop detection. The system also has the capability for cloud-based IoT integration.

The objective of this project is to address the increasing labor costs and shortage of workforce in the shoe industry by introducing automation. The system aims to replace manual processes with automated plasma spraying, improving efficiency and consistency. It will be manufactured and implemented in Taiwanese shoe manufacturing outsourcing factories located in the northern region of Vietnam.
